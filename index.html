				<p>Hello World!, I am Randy Wong, </p>
				<p>a scientist (specifically a programmer), a mathematician, and an visionary.  I recently graduated from California Polytechnic University, Pomona with a degree in Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. Computer technology is all about innovation and keeping up with the current trends in society. Programming may seem like an application which shows a bunch of lights flashing but it is so much more than that, it is the work of a programmer and there is a science behind it. I am constantly learning new ways to implement my knowledge in the work field. I have a passion for learning new ways to adapt to the innovation of computer science. I am interesting learning more about big data.
	As far as application go, I want to change the world! I want to build good software to help society, to help people maximize their full potential, and make good people even better.I am also looking for volunteering opportunities so feel free to message me about your cause!</p>
